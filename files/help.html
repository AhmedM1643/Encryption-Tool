            <p class="tool-desc">Encryption Tool is a tool that allows you to encrypt and decrypt the chat between you and your friends, 
                so that if anyone read the chat between you he will not understand anything unless you tell him. 
                The idea of the tool that you enter a letter and the tool will automaticly turn that letter to a code. 
                For example if you put in the input "Hello", the tool will take every letter and change it to the Dictionary
                of codes stored in it and it will return the result which is "85!!$", the amazing part in this tool is that
                you can decrypt the code converted, this is because when we send the code in a message to our friend,
                he will not understand anything unless he go to the website and put it in the decrypt input and it will return for him "Hello"
                now he will understand the encrypted words.
